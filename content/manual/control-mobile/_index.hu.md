------

Starting from version 1.1.9, the Android client has added the functions of sharing the phone screen and sharing the file system of the phone.

- Android 6 and above is required for screen sharing
- Android 10 or above is required to share the internal audio of the mobile phone system
- iOS does not yet support screen sharing


#### **Request permissions and start services**

Click on `Share Screen` from the bottom navigation bar

Configure various permissions as needed. Every time you start RustDesk, you need to request "Screen Capture" and "Input Control" permissions again.

**Remote mouse control shortcuts:**

- Click the right mouse button: go back
- Click the mouse wheel: Home

#### **Start service**

After obtaining the `screen capture` permission, the service will be automatically started. You can also click the `Start service` button to start the service. After the service is started, it can accept desktop control requests from other devices.

If the `file transfer` permission is enabled, it can also accept file control requests from other devices.

After the service is started, a unique ID and random password will be automatically obtained for this device. Other devices can control the phone through the ID and password, or manually confirm when a new request is received.

{{% notice note %}}
1. Clicking `Start Service` will enable the `Screen capture` permission by default.
2. When the `screen capture` permission is not obtained, other devices cannot issue control requests.
3. Except for the `screen capture` permission, the switching of other permissions will only affect the new connection, and will not affect the established connection. If you need to switch permissions for an established connection, please close the current connection first, modify the permissions, and then receive a control request.
