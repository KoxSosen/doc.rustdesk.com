## Install your own server with docker(-compose)

### Requirements
You need to have Docker/Podman installed to run a rustdesk-server as a docker-container

### Docker examples
#### Linux/amd64
```bash
sudo docker image pull rustdesk/rustdesk-server
sudo docker run --name hbbs -p 21115:21115 -p 21116:21116 -p 21116:21116/udp -p 21118:21118 -v `pwd`:/root -it --net=host --rm rustdesk/rustdesk-server hbbs -r <relay-server-ip[:port]> 
sudo docker run --name hbbr -p 21117:21117 -p 21119:21119 -v `pwd`:/root -it --net=host --rm rustdesk/rustdesk-server hbbr 
```
#### Linux/arm64v8
```bash
sudo docker image pull rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest-arm64v8
sudo docker run --name hbbs -p 21115:21115 -p 21116:21116 -p 21116:21116/udp -p 21118:21118 -v `pwd`:/root -it --net=host --rm rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest-arm64v8 hbbs -r <relay-server-ip[:port]> 
sudo docker run --name hbbr -p 21117:21117 -p 21119:21119 -v `pwd`:/root -it --net=host --rm rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest-arm64v8 hbbr 
```
<a name="net-host"></a>

{{% notice note %}}
`--net=host` only works on Linux, which makes `hbbs`/`hbbr` see the real incoming IP Address rather than the Container IP (172.17.0.1).
If `--net=host` works fine, the `-p` options are not used.

**Please remove `--net=host` if see connection problem on your platform**

### Docker-Compose examples
For running the docker files with an docker-compose.yml as here describer you need to have docker-compose installed.
#### Linux/amd64
```yaml
version: '3'

networks:
  rustdesk-net:
    external: false

services:
  hbbs:
    container_name: hbbs

      - 21118:21118
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbs -r example.com:21117
    volumes:

```


## Set up your own server instance without using Docker

### STEP-1 : Download server-side software programs

[Download](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server/).

Platform versions provided:

- Linux
- Windows

The tutorial below is based on Linux build.

There are two executables and a folder:

- `hbbs` - RustDesk ID/Rendezvous server
- `hbbr` - RustDesk relay server

They are built on CentOS Linux 7, tested on CentOS Linux 7/8 and Ubuntu 18/20.

#### Server Requirements

The hardware requirements are very low; the minimum configuration of a basic cloud server is enough, and the CPU and memory requirements are minimal. You can also use an Raspberry Pi or something similar. Regarding the network size, if the TCP hole punching direct connection fails, the relay traffic will be consumed. The traffic of a relay connection is between 30k-3M/s (1920x1080 screen), depending on the resolution settings and screen update。 If it is only for office work demand, the traffic is around 100K/s.

### STEP-2 : Run hbbs and hbbr on server

Run hbbs/hbbr on your server (Centos or Ubuntu). We suggust you use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) managing your service.

```bash
./hbbs -r <relay-server-ip[:port]> 
./hbbr 
```

or run hbbs/hbbr with pm2

```bash
pm2 start hbbs -- -r <relay-server-ip[:port]> 
pm2 start hbbr 
```

<a name="demo"></a>
{{% notice note %}}
pm2 requires nodejs v16+, if you fail to run pm2 (e.g. you can not see `hbbs`/`hbbr` in `pm2 list`), please download and install LTS version nodejs from https://nodejs.org. If you want to make `hbbs`/`hbbr` auto-run after reboot, please check out `pm2 save` and `pm2 startup`. More about [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/). Another good tool for your logs is [pm2-logrotate](https://github.com/keymetrics/pm2-logrotate).

The `-r` parameter of `hhbs` is not mandatory, it is just convenient for you not to specify a relay server on the controlled client side. You do not need to specify port if you are using default 21117 port. The relay server specified by the client has a higher priority than this.
{{% /notice %}}

By default, `hbbs` listens on 21115(tcp) and 21116(tcp/udp), 21118(tcp),and `hbbr` listens on 21117(tcp), 21119(tcp). Be sure to open these ports in the firewall. **Please note that 21116 should be enabled both for TCP and UDP**. 21115 is used for NAT type test, 21116/UDP is used for ID registration and heartbeat service, 21116/TCP is used for TCP hole punching and connection service, 21117 is used for Relay services, and 21118 and 21119 are used to support web clients. If you do not need web client (21118, 21119) support, the corresponding ports can be disabled.

- TCP(**21115, 21116, 21117, 21118, 21119**)
- UDP(**21116**)

Please run with the `-h` option to see help if you want to choose your own port.

<a name="net-host"></a>

{{% notice note %}}
`--net=host` only works on Linux, which makes `hbbs`/`hbbr` see the real incoming IP Address rather than the Container IP (172.17.0.1).
If `--net=host` works fine, the `-p` options are not used.

**Please remove `--net=host` if see connection problem on your platform**

### STEP-3 : Set hbbs/hbbr address on client-side

Click on the Menu button on the right side of ID as shown below, and choose "ID/Relay Server".

![](/docs/en/self-host/install/images/server-set-menu.png)

Enter the `hbbs` host or IP Address in the `ID server` input box (local side + remote side). The other two addresses can be left blank, RustDesk will automatically deduce (if not specially set), and the relay server refers to `hbbr` (21116 port).

e.g.

```nolang
hbbs.example.com
```

or

```nolang
hbbs.example.com:21116
```

![](/docs/en/self-host/install/images/server-set-window.png)

#### Put config in rustdesk.exe file name (Windows only)

Change `rustdesk.exe` to rustdesk-`host=<host-ip-or-name>,key=<public-key-string>`.exe, e.g. rustdesk-`host=192.168.1.137,key=xfdsfsd32=32`.exe. You can see the config result in the About Window below.

<a name="invalidchar"></a>
{{% notice note %}}
You need to set both `host` and `key`, missing either one will not work.

If there are invalid characters in the key which can not be used in a Windows file name, please remove the
`id_ed25519` file from your server and restart `hbbs`/`hbbr`. This will cause the `id_ed25519.pub` file to regenerate. You may need to
repeat this process until you get valid characters.

## Key

Different from the old version, the key in this version is mandatory, but you don't need to set it yourself. When `hbbs` runs for the first time, it will automatically generate a pair of encrypted private and public keys (respectively located in the `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` files in the running directory), whose main purpose is for communication encryption.

If you did not fill in the `Key:` (the content in the public key file `id_ed25519.pub`) in the previous step, it does not affect the connection, but the connection cannot be encrypted.

```bash
cat ./id_ed25519.pub
````

If you want to prohibit users without the key from establishing non-encrypted connections, please add the `-k _` parameter when running `hbbs` and `hbbr`, for example:

```bash
./hbbs -r <relay-server-ip[:port]> -k _
./hbbr -k _
```

If you want to change the key, remove the `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` files and restart `hbbs`/`hbbr`，`hbbs` will generate a new key pair.
